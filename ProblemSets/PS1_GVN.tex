\section{Why Data Science?}

Data science allows people to manipulate massive amounts of information in order to gain insights about what the data represents. As data collection grows, a better understanding of the world can be created. I am taking this class because I want to increase the tools available to me for obtaining and understanding data. I also want to increase my ability to create models. I understand that these goals are vague, but I hope the project I choose will help me achieve them. Currently, I am interested in sports analytics. I'm interested in creating a predictive model for the NBA. I believe this project would be challenging yet fun. By creating this model, I would learn many of the skills that I desire. After graduation, my goal is to work in financial analysis using data analytics.
